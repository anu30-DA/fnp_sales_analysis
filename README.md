This project involves creating an interactive sales dashboard using Excel, Power Pivot, and Power Query Editor to analyze sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior. Power Query was used for data cleaning and transformation, while Power Pivot enabled data modeling and DAX calculations for key metrics. The dashboard includes dynamic charts, slicers, and a timeline to analyze revenue, orders, and regional sales over different periods.
